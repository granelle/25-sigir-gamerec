Task: Generate a code in Python based on given tools.

The resulting variable, `output`, should contain relevant information needed to recommend <platform> games based on a user request. 
The output should be a Dict[str, str] where a key denote what the information is about and the value is the information.

For example, a simple output may look like this:

output = {
    "Lookup 'Murder Mystery 2' (liked by user)": "Genre: Survival. In this game, players are divided into...",
    "Search results for 'fighting'": "1. Right 2 Fight --- Genre: Fighting. The game is...\n2.The Strongest Battlegrounds...."
}

You can use the following functions in your code (already defined, so don't define them):

<tools>


Here is the user request:

<input>


Fill in the following template:

```python
formatted_request = <json_input>

output = {}  # dictionary of relevant information

# your code here
```

Make sure the syntax is correct. Don't say anything else.
